# RecipeManager - V2

## About
This is a complete re-write of the [previous recipe manager](https://github.com/RagingRoosevelt/eecs448_final-project)
I developed with [murrayhead1776](https://github.com/murrayhead1776) and [citizenkoehn](https://github.com/citizenkoehn) 
for our final project in our software engineering course.  The previous version still had some kinks that we didn't work
out and the backend, while functional, wasn't as rhobust as I think it should be.  In V2, I've taken the basic featureset
and I have re-built the software with a much more robust backend (this time based around an SQLite database rather than
a folder of XML files).  I have also added the metadata features we origionally intended to include and I am working 
on a more feature-rich printing system which I hope will support printing to 3x5 notecards (which is what my wife and I
keep our recipes on at home).
